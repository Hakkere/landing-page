  <h1>Hakkere - The HealthTech Studio</h1>
  <p>Hakkere turns health tech ideas into working, investment-ready prototypes.</p>

  <p>We help researchers, clinicians, and entrepreneurs build their first working prototype - the one that gets you funded.</p>

  <p>We've built:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Embedded systems</b> for wearable electronic devices</li>
    <li><b>Deep learning models</b> to detect heart arrhythmias in underserved populations</li>
    <li><b>Robotic automation systems</b> for a biotech manufacturing process</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We are based near the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/precincts/rhip/hth">UNSW Health Translation Hub</a> in Sydney, Australia.</p>

  <p><a href="mailto:hello@hakkere.com">Contact us</a> to book a free consultation to discuss your prototyping needs.</p>
